ESP-IDF template app
====================

Testing different sensors using the esp32-c6-devkitC1 module Tested the DHT-11 module using the esp-idf component library provided here: https://github.com/UncleRus/esp-idf-lib. Tested the HC-SRO4 module using the same library. The "rgb_led.c" and "rgb_led.h" files are stolen from another ongoing project of mine for debugging, that's why the functions have weird names.


This is a template application to be used with [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

Please check [ESP-IDF docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for getting started instructions.
